### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Ashish Khadka
#### ðŸŽ¯ About Me
Iâ€™m a lifelong learner passionate about combining business expertise with data-driven solutions! I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Studies, and after over 10 years of experience in marketing and sales (including as an Area Manager in the pharmaceutical industry), Iâ€™m now diving into the exciting world of technology and data analysis.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m currently sharpening my technical skills in Python, exploring libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to analyze and visualize data. My background in finance, economics, and administration gives me a strong foundation for understanding complex systems, while my passion for learning new tools like MySQL and Excel keeps me excited about solving real-world problems.

ðŸš€ As I transition into the tech space, Iâ€™m actively working on projects that apply data insights to make a difference. Iâ€™m all about collaboration, creativity, and using data to tell impactful stories.
